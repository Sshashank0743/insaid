# House-Price-Prediction

- Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. In   this project, house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses. The goal of this   project is to create a regression model that are able to accurately estimate the price of the house given the features.

## Problem Statement

- Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers . Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won’t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition’s data-set proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Objectives:

### Objectives:

1. Predict the sale price for each house.

2. Minimize the difference between predicted and actual rating (RMSE/MSE)

## Mapping the real world problem to a Machine Learning Problem:

This problem involves predicting the prices of the houses which are continuous and real valued outputs. Thus, this is a Regression Problem.

## Performance Metric:

· Using Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) as the performance metric . To know more about it please click on : “Root Mean Square Error” .

## Machine Learning Objective and Constraints:

1. Minimize RMSE.

2. Try to provide some interpretability.
